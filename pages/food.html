                The original idea of Moussaka, which includes layers of vegetables and meat, came to the Byzantine Empire and the Balkans through trade and conquest. The name "Moussaka" comes from the Arabic word "musaqqa’a," meaning "chilled." However, the Moussaka we know today, with its layers of eggplant, minced meat, and creamy béchamel sauce, became popular in the early 20th century thanks to Nikolaos Tselementes. His version of Moussaka, moved away from traditional olive oil-based Greek dishes by adding a rich béchamel sauce for extra creaminess.

                In Greek culture, cooking food on spits or skewers goes back to the Bronze Age. Digging in Santorini, Greece, found stone cooking supports used before the Thera eruption in the 17th century BC. Souvlaki was a popular dish in Santorini as far back as 2000 BC. In Mycenaean Greece, "souvlaki trays" were found in Gla, Mycenae, and Pylos. These portable grills were rectangular ceramic pans that held skewers of meat. Greek literature, including Homer's Iliad, mentions meat roasted on spits.
